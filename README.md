# E-Commerce-Cli-Project
The C++ application aimed to implement Data Structures and Algorithms in a Command Line Application. It involved utilizing Linked Lists, Priority Queues, and Heap to create an inventory list and maintain customer history. The application efficiently handled automatic inventory reorder functionality and allowed sorting inventory based on expiry date.

To store data, the backend utilized a JSON file, which housed customer and inventory information. Transactions and orders were seamlessly executed by reading the JSON file, updating the relevant data structures, and then saving the modified data back to the disk. The JSON file was parsed using a custom built parser
